Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
# Solution Complexity
- $O(n)$ time complexity
- $O(1)$ space complexity
# Thought Process
- The naÃ¯ve solution would result in a time complexity of $O(n)$ and space complexity of $O(n)$. We would simply initialize a [[Hash Tables]] and iterate through `nums` and update the count of each element in `nums`, while keeping track of the element with the highest count
- As we know that the majority element will always appear more than $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ times in `nums`, we can use the [[Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm]] to obtain a solution with a time complexity of $O(n)$ and space complexity of $O(1)$. The algorithm maintains the current majority element and its count thus far as we iterate through `nums`. When the current majority element has a count of zero (i.e. seen equal number of other non-majority elements), it replaces the current majority element with the next element in `nums` and repeats the process
- The main intuition of the algorithm is since there are more than $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ majority elements in `nums`, the majority element will have more than $\lfloor n / 2 \rfloor$ votes, and hence will be the current majority element with at least a count of 1 at the end of the iteration of `nums`
# Solution
- Initialize the current majority element and its count
- Iterate through `nums` and update the current majority element and its count. Return the current majority element at the end of the iteration of `nums`
```Python
class Solution:
	def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		ret, count = nums[0], 1

		for n in nums[1:]:
			if count == 0:
				ret, count = n, 1
			elif n == ret:
				count += 1
			else:
				count -= 1

		return ret
```
